# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- `opn_delete_dns_alias` deletes an Unbound DNS host alias by UUID. Aliases (a
  hostname nested under a parent host override, shown as `_children` entries
  in `opn_list_dns_overrides`) are a distinct OPNsense object type from host
  overrides, with their own `delHostAlias` endpoint — `opn_delete_dns_override`
  only calls `delHostOverride`, which returns a bare "not found" for an
  alias's UUID rather than deleting it.

### Fixed

- Declared `httpx` as a direct dependency instead of relying on it arriving
  transitively via `fastmcp`. `api_client.py` does `import httpx` directly,
  but current `fastmcp` (4.x) resolves to `httpx2` — a distinct package, not
  a version of `httpx` — so a fresh install (`pip install -e .` or a Docker
  build) got `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'httpx'` at startup.

### Changed

- This fork publishes its Docker image to `ghcr.io/rarosalion/opnsense-mcp-server`
  (via `publish-ghcr.yml`, using the repo's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no separate
  registry account needed) instead of upstream's Docker Hub workflow.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- `opn_mcp_info` reports `savepoint_support` (`true`/`false`/`null` when unprobed), so
  rollback availability can be checked before the first write instead of being discovered
  from the result of one.

### Fixed

- **Firewall:** all savepoint-protected write tools failed with `Endpoint not found` on
  OPNsense 26.7+. Upstream removed the filter savepoint/rollback actions in core commit
  `17b8461` and the re-added `applyAction()` no longer accepts a revision parameter, so
  `firewall/filter/savepoint` and `firewall/filter/cancelRollback` are gone. This broke
  `opn_add_firewall_rule`, `opn_update_firewall_rule`, `opn_delete_firewall_rule`,
  `opn_toggle_firewall_rule`, `opn_add_nat_rule`, `opn_update_nat_rule`,
  `opn_delete_nat_rule`, `opn_delete_firewall_category`, `opn_set_rule_categories`,
  `opn_add_icmpv6_rules` and `opn_confirm_changes` — the savepoint call aborted every
  write before it reached the actual endpoint.

### Changed

- `SavepointManager` probes the savepoint API once per session and degrades to
  direct-apply mode when it is absent: `create()` returns an empty revision, `apply()`
  is sent without the revision suffix, and `opn_confirm_changes` returns
  `not_applicable`. Detection is a runtime endpoint probe rather than a version gate;
  the detected version only corroborates a 404 whose error body is localised.
- Tool docstrings and result messages no longer promise a 60-second auto-revert
  unconditionally. **On OPNsense 26.7+ firewall changes apply immediately and are not
  rolled back automatically** — take a config backup before write operations.
- Degrade detection requires OPNsense's own "endpoint does not exist" answer: a bare HTTP
  404 from a reverse proxy or WAF no longer strips the rollback net, and once savepoints
  are proven to work in a session a later failure raises instead of silently downgrading.
  `opn_confirm_changes` therefore never reports `not_applicable` while a rollback timer
  from this session may still be armed.
- `opn_add_icmpv6_rules` no longer claims changes were applied when every rule creation
  failed and `apply()` was skipped.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- **Firewall:** 6 new CRUD tools for full alias and rule lifecycle management:
  - `opn_update_alias` — update alias name, content, type, or description (read-modify-write)
  - `opn_delete_alias` — delete an alias by UUID
  - `opn_toggle_alias` — toggle alias enabled/disabled state
  - `opn_update_firewall_rule` — update any field on a filter rule (savepoint-protected)
  - `opn_update_nat_rule` — update a NAT port forwarding rule (savepoint-protected)
  - `opn_delete_nat_rule` — delete a NAT port forwarding rule (savepoint-protected)
- **DNS:** 2 new tools completing DNS override lifecycle:
  - `opn_update_dns_override` — update hostname, domain, server, or description
  - `opn_delete_dns_override` — delete a DNS host override
- **DHCP:** 2 new tools completing dnsmasq range lifecycle:
  - `opn_update_dnsmasq_range` — update range addresses, lease time, or RA config
  - `opn_delete_dnsmasq_range` — delete a DHCP range
- **Services:** 2 new tools completing DDNS account lifecycle:
  - `opn_update_ddns_account` — update DDNS account settings (password write-only)
  - `opn_delete_ddns_account` — delete a DDNS account
- 10 new API endpoint registrations with dual camelCase/snake_case support

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **System:** `opn_mcp_info` — query MCP server version, write mode, detected OPNsense version, and API style
- **System:** MCP server version now included in protocol-level `initialize` handshake via FastMCP
- **DNS:** `opn_update_dnsbl` — reload DNSBL blocklist files and restart Unbound without config changes (manual recovery tool)

### Fixed

- **DNS:** DNSBL tools (`opn_set_dnsbl`, `opn_add_dnsbl_allowlist`, `opn_remove_dnsbl_allowlist`) now restart Unbound after regenerating blocklist files, flushing DNS cache so changes take effect immediately. Previously, old cached `0.0.0.0` entries (TTL 72000s) persisted and toggling DNSBL off→on left lists unloaded.

### Changed

- **DNS:** DNSBL tool response format changed from `{"applied": "OK"}` to `{"dnsbl_status": "OK", "service_status": "ok"}` for clearer status reporting

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **DNS:** 5 new DNSBL (DNS Blocklist) management tools:
  - `opn_list_dnsbl` — list blocklist configurations with providers and status
  - `opn_get_dnsbl` — get full blocklist config by UUID (providers, allowlists, settings)
  - `opn_set_dnsbl` — update blocklist settings (read-modify-write, preserves unmodified fields)
  - `opn_add_dnsbl_allowlist` — add domains to allowlist without overwriting existing entries
  - `opn_remove_dnsbl_allowlist` — remove domains from allowlist
- **DNS:** 8 new API endpoints registered for Unbound DNSBL operations
- **Integration tests:** DNSBL read-only tests in live test suite, plus dedicated write round-trip test

### Changed

- **CI:** Updated GitHub Actions to Node.js 24-compatible versions (checkout v5, setup-python v6, docker/login-action v4, docker/build-push-action v7)
- **Docs:** Replaced arbitrary tool count cap with quality guidelines (no overlapping tools, clear naming)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Firewall:** `opn_add_firewall_rule` now supports 8 additional parameters:
  - `destination_not` — invert destination match (e.g. `!Private_Networks` for internet-only rules)
  - `sequence` — control rule ordering within priority groups
  - `source_not` — invert source match
  - `categories` — assign category UUIDs at creation time (saves extra API roundtrip)
  - `source_port` — source port filtering
  - `log` — per-rule logging toggle
  - `gateway` — policy-based routing via specific gateway
  - `quick` — now configurable (was hardcoded to True); set False for last-match-wins logic

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **Diagnostics:** `opn_dns_lookup` now sends correct API payload (`dns.settings.hostname` instead of `dns.hostname`) — lookups were silently failing with validation error
- **VPN:** `opn_ipsec_status` now uses POST for `searchPhase1`/`searchPhase2` endpoints — GET was returning empty or failed responses
- **VPN:** `opn_openvpn_status` now uses POST with pagination for all three search endpoints (instances, sessions, routes)
- **Services:** `opn_crowdsec_status` now uses POST for decisions/alerts search — consistent with `opn_crowdsec_alerts`

### Security

- **Diagnostics:** Expanded hostname validation to reject additional shell metacharacters (`(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`, `'`, `"`, `\`, space)
- **Diagnostics:** `opn_dns_lookup` now validates the `server` parameter against the same injection rules as `hostname`

### Changed

- **Firewall:** `opn_firewall_log` now supports client-side filtering via `source_ip`, `destination_ip`, `action`, `interface`, and `limit` parameters — reduces context window size when investigating specific devices

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- Version numbers synced across pyproject.toml, \_\_init\_\_.py, and CHANGELOG (was stuck at 0.1.0)
- README updated to document all 60 tools (was 57 — missing firewall categories, ICMPv6 rules, NDP table, IPv6 status)
- Narrowed broad `except Exception` to specific exceptions in `opn_ipv6_status`

### Added

- CLI entry point: `opnsense-mcp` command available after `pip install`
- `__main__.py` for `python -m opnsense_mcp` support
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker for downstream type checking
- Test registration updated to cover all 60 tools
